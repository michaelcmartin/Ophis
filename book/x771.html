    Procedures let you break a computation up into different parts,
    then use them independently.  However, compilers do a lot of work
    for you behind the scenes to let you think this.  Consider the
    following assembler code.  How many times does the loop
    execute?

    of the X register.  If it does, than all sorts of chaos could
    result.  For major routines that aren't called often but are
    called in places where the register state is important, you should
    store the old registers on the stack with code like this:

>    (Remember, the last item pushed onto the stack is the first one
    pulled off, so you have to restore them in reverse order.)  That's
    three more bytes on the stack, so you don't want to do this if you
    don't absolutely have to.  If <TT

    actually <I

    and pushes important registers onto the stack before the routine
    is called, then restores them afterwards.  Each technique has its
    advantages and disadvantages.  The best way to handle it in your
    own code is to mark at the top of each routine which registers
    need to be saved by the caller.  (It's also useful to note things
    like how it takes arguments and how it returns values.)
