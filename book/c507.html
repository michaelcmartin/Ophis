>    Ophis is intended to produce cross-assembled binaries that will
    run in a variety of contexts. The expectation is that most users
    will be writing for emulated versions of hardware from when the
    6502 chip was current, and producing files either for those
    emulators or for devices that will transfer the results to real
    hardware. This chapter describes the support routines and examples
    to make those tasks easier.

          it also uses a different mechanism for returning to BASIC
          when done that is more robust in the face of self-modifying
          programs such as those produced by self-extracting
          compressed executables or onefiled multipart programs. It is

        counteract this, BASICs of the era did floating point in

        arithmetic operations. These operations are largely
        unavailable to machine language programmers.

>        BASIC stores floating point numbers in a five-byte format, but
        translates them into a seven-byte format to do actual work in
        two Floating Point Accumulators (FAC1 and FAC2). Ophis will
        let you specify 5-byte constants with
        the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.cbmfloat</TT
> directive, which takes a
        string and produces the requisite five-byte value.
