>    Most of the time, you care about function pointers because you've
    arranged them in some kind of table.  You hand it an index
    representing the type of your argument, or which method it is
    you're calling, or some other determinator, and then you index
    into an array of routines and execute the right one.
  </P
><P
>    Writing a generic routine to do this is kind of a pain.  First you
    have to pass a 16-bit pointer in, then you have to dereference it
    to figure out where your table is, then you have to do an indexed
    dereference on <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>that</I
> to get the routine you
    want to run, then you need to copy it out to somewhere fixed so
    that you can write your jump instruction.  And making this
    non-generic doesn't help a whole lot, since that only saves you
    the first two steps, but now you have to write them out in every
    single indexed jump instruction.  If only there were some way to
    easily and quickly pass in a local pointer directly...
  </P
><P
>    Something, say, like the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JSR</TT
> instruction, only not for
    program code.
  </P
><P
>    Or we could just use the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JSR</TT
> statement itself,
    but only call this routine at the ends of other routines, much
    like we were organizing for indirect jumps to begin with.  This
    lets us set up routines that look like this:

><P
>    Where the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>alpha'x</TT
> routines are the ones to be
    called when the index has that value.  This leaves the
    implementation of do'jump'table, which in this case uses the Y
    register to hold the index:

>    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>TYA:ASL:TAY:INY</TT
> sequence can actually be
    omitted if you don't mind having your Y indices be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
    etc., instead of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.  Likewise, the instructions
    dealing with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_scratch</TT
> can be omitted if you
    don't mind trashing the accumulator.  Keeping the accumulator and
    X register pristine for the target call comes in handy, though,
    because it means we can pass in a pointer argument purely in
    registers.  This will come in handy soon...
