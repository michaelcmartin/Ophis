>, there are better ways
    to handle waiting than just executing vast numbers of NOPs.  The
    Commodore 64 KERNAL library includes a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rdtim</TT
>
    routine that returns the uptime of the machine, in
    60<SUP
>th</SUP
>s of a second, as a 24-bit integer.
    The Commodore 64 programmer's guide available online actually has
    a bug in it, reversing the significance of the A and Y registers.
    The accumulator holds the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>least</I
> significant
    byte, not the most.

>    This works, but it eats up two bytes of file space that don't
    really need to be specified.  Also, it's modifying data inside a
    program text area, which isn't good if you're assembling to a ROM
    chip.  (Since the Commodore 64 stores its programs in RAM, it's
    not an issue for us here.)  A slightly better solution is to
    use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.alias</TT
> to assign the names to chunks of RAM
    somewhere.  There's a 4K chunk of RAM from $C000 through $CFFF
    between the BASIC ROM and the I/O ROM that should serve our
    purposes nicely.  We can replace the definitions
    of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_tmp</TT

>    This works better, but now we've just added a major bookkeeping
    burden upon ourselves&#8212;we must ensure that no routines step on
    each other.  What we'd really like are two separate program
    counters&#8212;one for the program text, and one for our variable
    space.

    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.text</TT
> command switches to the program-text
    counter, and the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.data</TT
> command switches to the
    variable-data counter.  When Ophis first starts assembling a file,
    it starts in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.text</TT
> mode.
  </P
><P
>    To reserve space for a variable, use the .space command.  This
    takes the form:

<TABLE

><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>.space varname size</PRE
></TD

    which assigns the name <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>varname</TT
> to the current
    program counter, then advances the program counter by the amount
    specified in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>size</TT
>.  Nothing is output to the
    final binary as a result of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.space</TT
> command.
  </P
><P
>    You may not put in any commands that produce output into
    a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.data</TT
> segment.  Generally, all you will be
    using are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.org</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.space</TT
>
    commands.  Ophis will not complain if you
    use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.space</TT
> inside a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.text</TT
>
    segment, but this is nearly always wrong. Remember,
    both <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.org</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.space</TT
> only
    ever alter the way that Ophis computes labels. They do not output
    any bytes, nor do they change where in the output file the bytes
    are actually written.
