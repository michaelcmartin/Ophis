>       Commodore 64 programs are stored in
       the <TT

       (such as CCS64 or VICE) can run <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

       programs directly; others need them to be transferred to
       a <TT

    </P
><P
>      The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

      has two bytes of header data: This is a little-endian number
      indicating the starting address.  The rest of the file is a
      single continuous chunk of data loaded into memory, starting at
      that address.  BASIC memory starts at memory location 2048, and
      that's probably where we'll want to start.
    </P
><P
>      Well, not quite.  We want our program to be callable from BASIC,
      so we should have a BASIC program at the start.  We guess the
      size of a simple one line BASIC program to be about 16 bytes.
      Thus, we start our program at memory location 2064 ($0810), and
      the BASIC program looks like this:

      filler to make our code actually start at location 2064.  These
      17 bytes will give us the file format and the BASIC code we need
      to have our machine language program run.

      Ophis what the program counter should be, so that it knows what
      values to assign to our labels.  The <TT

      (origin) command tells Ophis this.  Thus, the Ophis code for our
