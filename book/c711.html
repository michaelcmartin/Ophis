  if/then/else, for/next, while loops, and procedures.  It also
  discusses basic use of variables, as well as arrays, multi-byte data

  hand-compiling pseudo-code for an insertion sort on linked lists

>      Notice that we had to change the addresses we're indexing from,
      because x takes a slightly different range of values.  The space
      savings is small here, and it's become slightly more unclear.
      (It also hasn't actually saved any time, because the lda and sta
      instructions are crossing a page boundary where they weren't
      before&#8212;but if the start or end arrays began at $b020 or
      something this wouldn't be an issue.)  This tends to work better
      when the precise value of the counter isn't used in the
      computation&#8212;so let us consider the NES, which uses memory
      location $2007 as a port to its video memory.  Suppose we wish
      to jam 4,096 copies of the hex value $20 into the video memory.

>      This is an example of a <I

      inside a loop.  Since our internal loop didn't need the X or Y
      registers, we got to use both of them, which is nice, because
      they have special incrementing and decrementing instructions.
      The accumulator lacks these instructions, so it is a poor choice
      to use for index variables.  If you have a bounded loop and
      don't have access to registers, use memory locations
      instead:
