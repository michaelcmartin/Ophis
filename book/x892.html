>    We've been talking about all these routines as if they could be
    copy-pasted or hand-compiled from C++ or Java code.  This isn't
    really the case, primarily because <SPAN

    in your average assembler routines aren't really local, so
    multiple calls to the same method will tend to trash the program
    state.  And since a lot of the machinery described here shares a
    lot of memory (in particular, every single method invocation
    everywhere shares a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>this</TT
>), attempting to shift
    over standard OO code into this format is likely to fail
    miserably.
  </P

>    You can get an awful lot of flexibility out of even just one layer
    of method-calls, though, given a thoughtful
    design. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>do'jump'table</TT
> routine, or one very
    like it, was extremely common in NES games in the mid-1980s and
    later, usually as the beginning of the frame-update loop.
  </P

>    If you find you really need multiple layers of method calls,
    though, then you really are going to need a full-on program stack,
    and that's going to be several kinds of mess.  That's the topic
    for the final chapter.
