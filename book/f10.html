><P
>    Ophis is an assembler for the 6502 microprocessor - the famous
    chip used in the vast majority of the classic 8-bit computers and
    consoles. Its primary design goals are code readability and output
    flexibility - Ophis has successfully been used to create programs
    for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Atari 2600, and various
    8-bit Commodore machines.
  </P
><P
>    Ophis's syntax is noticably different from the formats
    traditionally used for these chips; it draws its syntactic
    inspiration primarily from the assemblers for more modern chips,
    where the role of tokens is determined more by what they're made
    of and their grammatical location on a line rather than their
    absolute position on a line. It also borrows the sophisticated
    methods of tracking the location of labels when writing relinkable
    code&#8212;Ophis expects that the final output it produces will have
    only a vague resemblance to the memory image when loaded. Most of
    the alternatives when Ophis was first designed would place
    instructions and data into a memory map and then dump that map.
  </P
><P
>    That said, there remain many actively used 6502 assemblers out
    there. If you're already a seasoned 6502 assembly programmer, or
    want to get your old sources built again, Ophis is likely not for
    you&#8212;however, if you are writing new code, or are new to the
    chip while still having other experience, then Ophis is a tool
    built with you in mind.

><P
>      The Ophis project started on a lark back in 2001.  My graduate
      studies required me to learn Perl and Python, and I'd been
      playing around with Commodore 64 emulators in my spare time, so
      I decided to learn both languages by writing a simple
      cross-assembler for the 6502 chip the C64 used in both.

      dubbed <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Perl65"</SPAN
>&#8212;was quickly abandoned, but
      the Python one saw more work. When it came time to name it, one
      of the things I had been hoping to do with the assembler was to
      produce working Apple II programs.  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

      Greek for <SPAN

>, and a number of traditions also
      use it as the actual <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>name</I
> of the serpent in
      the Garden of Eden.  So, Pythons, snakes, and stories involving
      really old Apples all combined to name the
      assembler.<A

>      Ophis slowly grew in scope and power over the years, and by 2005
      was a very powerful, flexible macro assembler that saw more use
      than I'd expect.  In 2007 Ophis 1.0 was formally released.
      However, Ophis was written for Python 2.1 and this became more
      and more untenable as time has gone by. As I started receiving
      patches for parts of Ophis, and as I used it for some projects
      of my own, it became clear that Ophis needed to be modernized
      and to become better able to interoperate with other
      toolchains. It was this process that led to Ophis 2.
    </P
><P
>      After its release Ophis 2 was picked up by a number of
      developers work with actual hardware from the period, including
      prototype machines that never saw production. Some of their
      contributions have refined the code generators for version 2.1.

>Ironically, cross-platform development
      for the Apple II is extremely difficult, and while Ophis has
      been very successfully used to develop code for the Commodore
      64, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Atari 2600, it has yet to
      actually be deployed on any of the Apples which inspired its
      name.</P
