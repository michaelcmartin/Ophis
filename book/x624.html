      NES code you'll find in the wild doesn't use aliases for control

      Any given product was generally one of a large selection of
      circuit boards with several ROM or support-logic chips 
      affixed to it. These circuit board configurations are generally
      referred to as "mappers" by developers because their
      effect is to implement various bankswitching schemes. The result
      is a program built out of parts, each with its own origin.
      A simple <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Hello World"</SPAN
> sample program ships with
      Ophis. It is configured to use "Mapper Zero", or a simulation of
      the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"NROM"</SPAN
> circuit board, which had no special
      bankswitching logic and simply wired the program chip and the
      graphics chip directly into the address bus. The sample code
      includes one source file for each chip, and then two wrapper
      files to knit them together into a file that other software will
      recognize. As of 2024, the UNIF format is entirely abandoned in
      favor of the backwards-compatible iNES 2.0 format.
