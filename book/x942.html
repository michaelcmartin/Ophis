>    Pointers are slow.  It sounds odd saying this, when C is the
    fastest language around on modern machines precisely because of
    its powerful and extensive use of pointers.  However, modern
    architectures are designed to be optimized for C-style code (as an
    example, the x86 architecture allows statements like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mov
    eax, [bs+bx+4*di]</TT
> as a single instruction), while the
    6502 is not.  An (Indirect, Y) operation can take up to 6 cycles
    to complete just on its own, while the preparation of that command
    costs additional time <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>and</I
> scribbles over a
    bunch of registers, meaning memory operations to save the values
    and yet more time spent.  The simple code given at the beginning
    of this essay&#8212;loading <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*b</TT
> into the
    accumulator&#8212;takes 7 cycles, not counting the 6 it takes to
    load b with the appropriate value to begin with.  If b is known to
    contain a specific value, we can write a single Absolute mode
    instruction to load its value, which takes only 4 cycles and also
    preserves the value in the Y register.  Clearly, Absolute mode
    should be used whenever possible.

>    One might be tempted to use self-modifying code to solve this
    problem.  This actually doesn't pay off near enough for the hassle
    it generates; for self-modifying code, the address must be
    generated, then stored in the instruction, and then the data must
    be loaded.  Cost: 16 cycles for 2 immediate loads, 2 absolute
    stores, and 1 absolute load.  For the straight pointer
    dereference, we generate the address, store it in the pointer,
    clear the index, then dereference that.  Cost: 17 cycles for 3
    immediate loads, 2 zero page stores, and 1 indexed indirect load.
    Furthermore, unlike in the self-modifying case, loops where simple
    arithmetic is being continuously performed only require repeating
    the final load instruction, which allows for much greater time
    savings over an equivalent self-modifying loop.

>    (This point is also completely moot for NES programmers or anyone
    else whose programs are sitting in ROM, because programs stored on
    a ROM cannot modify themselves.)
