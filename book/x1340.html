>        In order to properly compute the locations of labels and the
        like, Ophis must keep track of where assembled code will
        actually be sitting in memory, and it strives to do this in a
        way that is independent both of the target file and of the
        target machine.

>program counter
          tracking</I
>. As it assembles the code, it keeps
          track of a virtual program counter, and uses that to
          determine where the labels should go.

          is a simple directive, setting the PC to the value
          that <TT

          case, one <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

          beginning of the code and sets the location for the rest of
          the code, which is one contiguous block.

           have a region of memory reserved for data without actually
           mapping that memory to the file. On some systems (typically
           cartridge-based systems where ROM and RAM are seperate, and
           the target file only specifies the ROM image) this is
           mandatory. In order to access these variables symbolically,
           it's necessary to put the values into the label lookup
           table.
         </P
><P
>           It is possible, but inconvenient, to do this
           with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.alias</TT
>, assigning a specific
           memory location to each variable. This requires careful
           coordination through your code, and makes creating reusable
           libraries all but impossible.
         </P
><P
>           A better approach is to reserve a section at the beginning
           or end of your program, put an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.org</TT
>
           directive in, then use the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.space</TT
>
           directive to divide up the data area.  This is still a bit
           inconvenient, though, because all variables must be
           assigned all at once. What we'd really like is to keep
           multiple PC counters, one for data and one for code.
         </P
><P
>           The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.text</TT
>
           and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.data</TT
> directives do this.  Each
           has its own PC that starts at zero, and you can switch
           between the two at any point without corrupting the other's
           counter. In this way each function can have
           a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.data</TT
> section (filled
           with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.space</TT
> commands) and
           a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.text</TT
> section (that contains the
           actual code). This lets our library routines be almost
           completely self-contained - we can have one source file
           that could be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.included</TT
> by multiple
           projects without getting in anything's way.
         </P

>           However, any given program may have its own ideas about
           where data and code go, and it's good to ensure with
           a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.checkpc</TT
> at the end of your code
           that you haven't accidentally overwritten code with data or
           vice versa. If your <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.data</TT
>
           segment <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>did</I
> start at zero, it's
           probably wise to make sure you aren't smashing the stack,
           too (which is sitting in the region from $0100 to
           $01FF).
         </P
><P
>           If you write code with no segment-defining statements in
           it, the default segment
           is <TT

>.
         </P
><P
>           The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>data</TT

           for organizing labels. As such, errors will be flagged if
           you attempt to actually output information into
           a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

>           One text and data segment each is usually sufficient, but
           for the cases where it is not, Ophis allows for user-defined
           segments. Putting a label
           after <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.text</TT
>
           or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

           end of the address space, but want to reserve the zero page
           for truly critical variables, and use the rest of RAM for
           everything else. Let's also assume that this is a 6510
           chip, and locations $00 and $01 are reserved for the I/O
           port. We could start our program off with:
