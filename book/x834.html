    There really isn't a lot you can do just with bytes.  This section
    talks about how to deal with larger and smaller elements.

>      An <I

      row.  An array of bytes is very easy to handle with the 6502
      chip, because the various indexed addressing modes handle it for
      you.  Just load the index into the X or Y register and do an
      absolute indexed load.  In general, these are going to be
      zero-indexed (that is, a 32-byte array is indexed from 0 to 31.)
      This code would initialize a byte array with 32 entries to
      0:

    </P

>      This approach to arrays has some limits.  Primary among them is
      that we can't have arrays of size larger than 256; we can't fit
      our index into the index register.  In order to address larger
      arrays, we need to use the indirect indexed addressing mode.  We
      use 16-bit addition to add the offset to the base pointer, then
      set the Y register to 0 and then load the value
      with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>lda (ptr),y</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>      Well, actually, we can do better than that.  Suppose we want to
      clear out 8K of ram, from $2000 to $4000.  We can use the Y
      register to hold the low byte of our offset, and only update the
      high bit when necessary.  That produces the following
      loop:

>      That's not directly relevant to arrays, but these sorts of
      things are good things to keep in mind when writing your code.
      Done well, they can make it much smaller and faster; done
      carelessly, they can force a lot of bizarre dependencies on your
      code and make it impossible to modify later.

>      A <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

      referred to as one variable.  This has no immediate
      representation in assembler.  If you have a global variable
      that's two bytes and a code pointer, this is exactly equivalent
      to three seperate variables.  You can just put one label in
      front of it, and refer to the first byte
      as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>label</TT

      as <TT

      a <TT

    </P
><P
>      This really applies to all data structures that take up more
      than one byte.  When dealing with the pointer, a 16-bit value,
      we refer to the low byte as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ptr</TT
>
      (or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>label+2</TT
>, in the example above), and the
      high byte as <TT

      (or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    </P
><P
>      Arrays of records are more interesting.  There are two
      possibilities for these.  The way most high level languages
      treat it is by keeping the records contiguous.  If you have an
      array of two sixteen bit integers, then the records are stored
      in order, one at a time.  The first is in location $1000, the
      next in $1004, the next in $1008, and so on.  You can do this
      with the 6502, but you'll probably have to use the indirect
      indexed mode if you want to be able to iterate
      conveniently.
    </P
><P
>      Another, more unusual, but more efficient approach is to keep
      each byte as a seperate array, just like in the arrays example
      above.  To illustrate, here's a little bit of code to go through
      a contiguous array of 16 bit integers, adding their values to
      some <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>total</TT
> variable:

>      Which approach is the right one depends on what you're doing.
      For large arrays, the first approach is better, as you only need
      to maintain one base pointer.  For smaller arrays, the easier
      indexing makes the second approach more convenient.
