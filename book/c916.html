>    A pointer is a variable holding the address of a memory location.
    Memory locations take 16 bits to represent on the 6502: thus, we
    need two bytes to hold it.  Any decent assembler will have ways of
    taking the high and low bytes of an address; use these to acquire
    the raw values you need.  The 6502 chip does not have any
    simple <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pure"</SPAN
> indirect modes (except
    for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JMP</TT
>, which is a matter for a later essay);
    all are indexed, and they're indexed different ways depending on
    which index register you use.

          statement must be y.  It cannot be x (that's a different
          form of indirection), and it cannot be a constant.  If
          you're doing a lot of indirection, be sure to keep your Y
          register free to handle the indexing on the
          pointers.

          and sometimes even correct: it dereferences the value next
          to <TT

          However, it is almost guaranteed that what you *really*
          wanted to do was compute <TT

          take the address of b, add 2 to <I

          and dereference that value); see the next section for how to
          do this properly.

>      In nearly all cases, it is the Y-register's version (Indirect
      Indexed) that you want to use when you're dealing with pointers.
      Even though either version could be used for this example, we
      use the Y register to establish this habit.
