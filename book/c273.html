    We will also abstract away our string printing technique into a
    macro which may be invoked at will, on arbitrary strings.  We will
    then multiply the output of our program tenfold.

      information and the BASIC program&#8212;are going to be the same
      in many, many programs.  Thus, we should put them into a header
      file to be included later.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.include</TT

      directive will load a file and insert it as source at the
      designated point.

CLASS="LITERAL"

      the file as long as it hasn't been included yet elsewhere.  It
      is useful for ensuring a library is linked in.

>      For pre-assembled code or raw binary data,
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.incbin</TT

      contents of a binary file directly in the output.  This is handy
      for linking in pre-created graphics or sound data.
    </P
><P
>      If you only wish to include part of a binary
      file, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.incbin</TT
> takes up to two optional
      arguments, naming the file offset at which to start reading and
      the number of characters to read.
    </P
><P
>      As a sample library, we will expand the definition of
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>chrout</TT
> routine to include the standard
      names for every KERNAL routine.  Our header file will
      then <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.require</TT
> it.
    </P
><P
>      We'll also add some convenience aliases for things like reverse
      video, color changes, and shifting between upper case/graphics
      and mixed case text.  We'd feed those to
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>chrout</TT
> routine to get their effects.
    </P
><P
>      Since there have been no interesting changes to the prelude, and
      the KERNAL values are standard, we do not reproduce them here.

      available in the <TT
