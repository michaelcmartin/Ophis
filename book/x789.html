>      Global variables are variables that can be reached from any
      point in the program.  Since the 6502 has no memory protection,
      these are easy to declare.  Take some random chunk of unused
      memory and declare it to be the global variables area.  All
      reasonable assemblers have commands that let you give a symbolic
      name to a memory location&#8212;you can use this to give your
      globals names.

      invocation of that procedure.  In modern architecures, this data
      is stored into and read directly off of the stack.  The 6502
      doesn't really let you do this cleanly; I'll discuss ways of
      handling it in a later essay.  If you're implementing a system
      from scratch, you can design your memory model to not require
      such extreme measures.  There are three basic techniques.

        really slow, it's often pointless, and it has a tendency to
        overflow the stack.  I can't recommend it.  But it does let
        you do recursion right, if you don't need to save much memory
        and you aren't recursing very deep.

        chunk of memory for use with its data.  All the variables are
        still, technically, globals; a
        routine <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

        but the discipline of <SPAN

        fast, both to write and to run, because loading a variable is
        an Absolute or Zero Page instruction.  Also, any procedure may
        call any other procedure, as long as it doesn't wind up
        calling itself at some point.
      </P

>        It has two major disadvantages.  First, if many routines need
        a lot of space, it can consume more memory than it should.
        Also, this technique can require significant assembler
        support&#8212;you must ensure that no procedure's local
        variables are defined in the same place as any other
        procedure, and it essentially requires a full symbolic linker
        to do right.  Ophis includes commands for <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>memory
        segmentation simulation</I
> that automate most of this
        task, and make writing general libraries feasible.

        only required that procedures don't write on the memory that
        their <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>callers</I

        program is organized into a bunch of procedures, and each fall
        into one of three sets:
      </P

><UL
><LI

></LI

><P
>        Now, each <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>set</I
> can be given its own chunk
        of memory, and we can be absolutely sure that no procedures
        overwrite each other.  Even if every procedure in set C uses
        the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>same</I
> memory location, they'll never
        step on each other, because there's no way to get to any other
        routine in set C <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

        C.
      </P

>        This has the same time efficiencies as procedure-based memory
        allocation, and, given a thoughtful design aimed at using this
        technique, also can use significantly less memory at run time.
        It's also requires much less assembler support, as addresses
        for variables may be assigned by hand without having to worry
        about those addresses already being used.  However, it does
        impose a very tight discipline on the design of the overall
        system, so you'll have to do a lot more work before you start
        actually writing code.

      you know that the value you're using is not going to change, you
      should fold it into the code, either as an Immediate operand

      This is especially important for ROM-based systems such as the
      NES; the NES has very little RAM available, so constants should
      be kept in the more plentiful ROM wherever possible.
