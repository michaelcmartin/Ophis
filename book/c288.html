    We will also abstract away our string printing technique into a
    macro which may be invoked at will, on arbitrary strings.  We will
    then multiply the output of our program tenfold.

      information and the BASIC program&#8212;are going to be the same
      in many, many programs.  Thus, we should put them into a header
      file to be included later.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.include</TT

      directive will load a file and insert it as source at the
      designated point.

>      A related directive, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.require</TT
>, will include
      the file as long as it hasn't been included yet elsewhere.  It
      is useful for ensuring a library is present somewhere in the
      final code.

>      For pre-assembled code or raw binary data,
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.incbin</TT
> directive lets you include the
      contents of a binary file directly in the output.  This is handy
      for linking in pre-created graphics or sound data.
    </P
><P
>      If you only wish to include part of a binary
      file, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.incbin</TT
> takes up to two optional
      arguments, naming the file offset at which to start reading and
      the number of characters to read.
    </P
><P
>      As a sample library, we will expand the definition of
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>chrout</TT
> routine to include the standard
      names for every KERNAL routine.  Our header file will
      then <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.require</TT
> it.
    </P
><P
>      We'll also add some convenience aliases for things like reverse
      video, color changes, and shifting between upper case/graphics
      and mixed case text.  We'd feed those to
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>chrout</TT
> routine to get their effects.
    </P
><P
>      Since there have been no interesting changes to the prelude, and
      the KERNAL values are standard, we do not reproduce them here.

      header is likely to be useful in your own projects, and it is
      available in the <TT
