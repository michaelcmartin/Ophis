      single continuous chunk of data loaded into memory, starting at

      so we should have a BASIC program at the start.  We guess the
      size of a simple one line BASIC program to be about 16 bytes.
      Thus, we start our program at memory location 2064 ($0810), and
      the BASIC program looks like this:

      We started at 2049, so we need 2 more bytes of filler to make
      our code actually start at location 2064.  These 17 bytes will
      give us the file format and the BASIC code we need to have our
      machine language program run.

      the <TT

      Ophis what the program counter should be, so that it knows what
      values to assign to our labels.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.org</TT

      (origin) command tells Ophis this.  Thus, the Ophis code for our
      header and linking info is:

>      We can do better still, though. That initial starting address
      of 2064 was only ever a guess; now that we know that we overshot
      by two bytes, we can simply change the starting address to 2062
      and omit the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.advance</TT
> directive entirely. In
      fact, we can even remove the space before the number and make it
      2061 instead&#8212;BASIC doesn't need that space in its
      instruction and it's arguably a wasted byte.
