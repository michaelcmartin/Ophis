        <title>Label types</title>
        <para>
          Normal labels are simply referred to by name. Anonymous
          labels may be referenced with strings of - or + signs (the
          label <literal>-</literal> refers to the immediate
          previous anonymous label, <literal>--</literal> the
          one before that, etc., while <literal>+</literal>
          refers to the next anonymous label), and the special
          label <literal>^</literal> refers to the program
          counter at the start of the current instruction or directive.
        </para>
        <para>
          Normal labels are <emphasis>defined</emphasis> by
          prefixing a line with the label name and then a colon
          (e.g., <literal>label:</literal>).  Anonymous labels
          are defined by prefixing a line with an asterisk
          (e.g., <literal>*</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
          Temporary labels are only reachable from inside the
          innermost enclosing <literal>.scope</literal>
          statement. They are identical to normal labels in every
          way, except that they start with an underscore.
        </para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>String types</title>
        <para>
          Strings are enclosed in double quotation marks. Backslashed
          characters (including backslashes and double quotes) are
          treated literally, so the string <literal>"The man said,
          \"The \\ character is the backslash.\""</literal> produces
          the ASCII sequence for <literal>The man said, "The \
          character is the backslash."</literal>
        </para>
        <para>
          Strings are generally only used as arguments to assembler
          directives&mdash;usually for filenames
          (e.g., <literal>.include</literal>) but also for string
          data (in association with <literal>.byte</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
          It is legal, though unusual, to attempt to pass a string to
          the other data statements.  This will produces a series of
          words/dwords where all bytes that aren't least-significant
          are zero.  Endianness and size will match what the directive
          itself indicated.
        </para>
      </section>

    <section>
      <title>Compound Arguments</title>
      <para>
        Compound arguments may be built up from simple ones, using the
        standard +, -, *, and / operators, which carry the usual
        precedence. Also, the unary operators &gt; and &lt;, which
        bind more tightly than anything else, provide the high and low
        bytes of 16-bit values, respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        Use brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ) when grouping
        arithmetic operations, as the parentheses are needed for the
        indirect addressing modes.
      </para>
      <para>
        Examples:

      <title>Memory Model</title>
      <para>
        In order to properly compute the locations of labels and the
        like, Ophis must keep track of where assembled code will
        actually be sitting in memory, and it strives to do this in a
        way that is independent both of the target file and of the
        target machine.
      </para>
      <section>
        <title>Basic PC tracking</title>
        <para>
          The primary technique Ophis uses is <emphasis>program counter
          tracking</emphasis>. As it assembles the code, it keeps
          track of a virtual program counter, and uses that to
          determine where the labels should go.
        </para>
        <para>
          In the absence of an <literal>.org</literal> directive, it
          assumes a starting PC of zero. <literal>.org</literal>
          is a simple directive, setting the PC to the value
          that <literal>.org</literal> specifies. In the simplest
          case, one <literal>.org</literal> directive appears at the
          beginning of the code and sets the location for the rest of
          the code, which is one contiguous block.
        </para>

       <section>
         <title>Basic Segmentation simulation</title>
         <para>
           However, this isn't always practical. Often one wishes to
           have a region of memory reserved for data without actually
           mapping that memory to the file. On some systems (typically
           cartridge-based systems where ROM and RAM are seperate, and
           the target file only specifies the ROM image) this is
           mandatory. In order to access these variables symbolically,
           it's necessary to put the values into the label lookup
           table.
         </para>
         <para>
           It is possible, but inconvenient, to do this
           with <literal>.alias</literal>, assigning a specific
           memory location to each variable. This requires careful
           coordination through your code, and makes creating reusable
           libraries all but impossible.
         </para>
         <para>
           A better approach is to reserve a section at the beginning
           or end of your program, put an <literal>.org</literal>
           directive in, then use the <literal>.space</literal>
           directive to divide up the data area.  This is still a bit
           inconvenient, though, because all variables must be
           assigned all at once. What we'd really like is to keep
           multiple PC counters, one for data and one for code.
         </para>
         <para>
           The <literal>.text</literal>
           and <literal>.data</literal> directives do this.  Each
           has its own PC that starts at zero, and you can switch
           between the two at any point without corrupting the other's
           counter. In this way each function can have
           a <literal>.data</literal> section (filled
           with <literal>.space</literal> commands) and
           a <literal>.text</literal> section (that contains the
           actual code). This lets our library routines be almost
           completely self-contained - we can have one source file
           that could be <literal>.included</literal> by multiple
           projects without getting in anything's way.
         </para>
         <para>
           However, any given program may have its own ideas about
           where data and code go, and it's good to ensure with
           a <literal>.checkpc</literal> at the end of your code
           that you haven't accidentally overwritten code with data or
           vice versa. If your <literal>.data</literal>
           segment <emphasis>did</emphasis> start at zero, it's
           probably wise to make sure you aren't smashing the stack,
           too (which is sitting in the region from $0100 to
           $01FF).
         </para>
         <para>
           If you write code with no segment-defining statements in
           it, the default segment
           is <literal>text</literal>.
         </para>
         <para>
           The <literal>data</literal> segment is designed only
           for organizing labels. As such, errors will be flagged if
           you attempt to actually output information into
           a <literal>data</literal> segment.
         </para>
       </section>
       <section>
         <title>General Segmentation Simulation</title>
         <para>
           One text and data segment each is usually sufficient, but
           for the cases where it is not, Ophis allows for user-defined
           segments. Putting a label
           after <literal>.text</literal>
           or <literal>.data</literal> produces a new segment with
           the specified name.
         </para>
         <para>
           Say, for example, that we have access to the RAM at the low
           end of the address space, but want to reserve the zero page
           for truly critical variables, and use the rest of RAM for
           everything else. Let's also assume that this is a 6510
           chip, and locations $00 and $01 are reserved for the I/O
           port. We could start our program off with:
         </para>
<programlisting>
.data
.org $200
.data zp
.org $2
.text
.org $800
</programlisting>
         <para>
           And, to be safe, we would probably want to end our code
           with checks to make sure we aren't overwriting anything:
         </para>
<programlisting>
.data
.checkpc $800
.data zp
.checkpc $100

       <para>
         Assembly language is a powerful tool&mdash;however, there are
         many tasks that need to be done repeatedly, and with
         mind-numbing minor modifications.  Ophis includes a facility
         for <emphasis>macros</emphasis> to allow this.  Ophis macros
         are very similar in form to function calls in higher level
         languages.

           To invoke a macro, either use

           name of the routine.  The previous macro may be expanded
           out in either of two ways, at any point in the
           source:
         </para>
         <programlisting>.invoke clr'screen</programlisting>
         <para>or</para>
         <programlisting>`clr'screen</programlisting>

         <title>Passing Arguments to Macros</title>
         <para>
           Macros may take arguments.  The arguments to a macro are
           all of the <quote>word</quote> type, though byte values may
           be passed and used as bytes as well.  The first argument in
           an invocation is bound to the label
           <literal>_1</literal>, the second
           to <literal>_2</literal>, and so on.  Here's a macro
           for storing a 16-bit value into a word pointer:
         </para>
<programlisting>
.macro store16   ; `store16 dest, src
	lda #&lt;_2
	sta _1
	lda #&gt;_2
	sta _1+1
.macend
</programlisting>
         <para>
           Macro arguments behave, for the most part, as if they were
           defined by <literal>.alias</literal>
           commands <emphasis>in the calling context</emphasis>.
           (They differ in that they will not produce duplicate-label
           errors if those names already exist in the calling scope,
           and in that they disappear after the call is
           completed.)
         </para>
       </section>
       <section>
         <title>Features and Restrictions of the Ophis Macro Model</title>
         <para>
           Unlike most macro systems (which do textual replacement),
           Ophis macros evaluate their arguments and bind them into the
           symbol table as temporary labels.  This produces some
           benefits, but it also puts some restrictions on what kinds of
           macros may be defined.
         </para>
         <para>
           The primary benefit of this <quote>expand-via-binding</quote>
           discipline is that there are no surprises in the semantics.
           The expression <literal>_1+1</literal> in the macro above
           will always evaluate to one more than the value that was
           passed as the first argument, even if that first argument is
           some immensely complex expression that an
           expand-via-substitution method may accidentally
           mangle.
         </para>
         <para>
           The primary disadvantage of the expand-via-binding
           discipline is that only fixed numbers of words and bytes
           may be passed.  A substitution-based system could define a
           macro including the line <literal>LDA _1</literal> and
           accept as arguments both <literal>$C000</literal>
           (which would put the value of memory location $C000 into
           the accumulator) and <literal>#$40</literal> (which
           would put the immediate value $40 into the accumulator).
           If you <emphasis>really</emphasis> need this kind of
           behavior, a run a C preprocessor over your Ophis source,
           and use <literal>#define</literal> to your heart's
           content.

       <title>Assembler directives</title>
       <para>
         Assembler directives are all instructions to the assembler
         that are not actual instructions. Ophis's set of directives
         follow.
       </para>
       <itemizedlist>
       <listitem><para><literal>.advance</literal> <emphasis>address</emphasis>:
      Forces the program counter to
      be <emphasis>address</emphasis>. Unlike
      the <literal>.org</literal>
      directive, <literal>.advance</literal> outputs zeroes until the
      program counter reaches a specified address. Attempting
      to <literal>.advance</literal> to a point behind the current
      program counter is an assemble-time error.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.alias</literal> <emphasis>label</emphasis> <emphasis>value</emphasis>: The
      .alias directive assigns an arbitrary value to a label. This
      value may be an arbitrary argument, but cannot reference any
      label that has not already been defined (this prevents
      recursive label dependencies).</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.byte</literal> <emphasis>arg</emphasis> [ , <emphasis>arg</emphasis>, ... ]:
      Specifies a series of arguments, which are evaluated, and
      strings, which are included as raw ASCII data. The final
      results of these arguments must be one byte in size. Seperate
      constants are seperated by comments.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.checkpc</literal> <emphasis>address</emphasis>: Ensures that the
      program counter is less than or equal to the address
      specified, and emits an assemble-time error if it is not.
      <emphasis>This produces no code in the final binary - it is there to
      ensure that linking a large amount of data together does not
      overstep memory boundaries.</emphasis></para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.data</literal> <emphasis>[label]</emphasis>: Sets the segment to
      the segment name specified and disallows output. If no label
      is given, switches to the default data segment.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.incbin</literal> <emphasis>filename</emphasis>: Inserts the
      contents of the file specified as binary data. Use it to
      include graphics information, precompiled code, or other
      non-assembler data.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.include</literal> <emphasis>filename</emphasis>: Includes the
      entirety of the file specified at that point in the program.
      Use this to order your final sources.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.org</literal> <emphasis>address</emphasis>: Sets the program
      counter to the address specified. <emphasis>This does not emit any
      code in and of itself, nor does it overwrite anything that
      previously existed.</emphasis> If you wish to jump ahead in memory,
      use <literal>.advance</literal>.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.require</literal> <emphasis>filename</emphasis>: Includes the entirety 
      of the file specified at that point in the program.  Unlike <literal>.include</literal>,
      however, code included with <literal>.require</literal> will only be inserted once.
      The <literal>.require</literal> directive is useful for ensuring that certain code libraries
      are somewhere in the final binary.  They are also very useful for guaranteeing that
      macro libraries are available.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.space</literal> <emphasis>label</emphasis> <emphasis>size</emphasis>: This
      directive is used to organize global variables. It defines the
      label specified to be at the current location of the program
      counter, and then advances the program counter <emphasis>size</emphasis>
      steps ahead. No actual code is produced. This is equivalent
      to <literal>label: .org ^+size</literal>.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.text</literal> <emphasis>[label]</emphasis>: Sets the segment to
      the segment name specified and allows output. If no label is

      <listitem><para><literal>.word</literal> <emphasis>arg</emphasis> [ , <emphasis>arg</emphasis>, ... ]:
      Like <literal>.byte</literal>, but values are all treated as two-byte
      values and stored low-end first (as is the 6502's wont). Use
      this to create jump tables (an unadorned label will evaluate
      to that label's location) or otherwise store 16-bit
      data.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.dword</literal> <emphasis>arg</emphasis> [ , <emphasis>arg</emphasis>, ...]:
      Like <literal>.word</literal>, but for 32-bit values.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.wordbe</literal> <emphasis>arg</emphasis> [ , <emphasis>arg</emphasis>, ...]:
      Like <literal>.word</literal>, but stores the value in a big-endian format (high byte first).</para></listitem>

      Like <literal>.dword</literal>, but stores the value high byte first.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.scope</literal>: Starts a new scope block. Labels
      that begin with an underscore are only reachable from within
      their innermost enclosing <literal>.scope</literal> statement.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.scend</literal>: Ends a scope block. Makes the
      temporary labels defined since the last <literal>.scope</literal>
      statement unreachable, and permits them to be redefined in a
      new scope.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.macro</literal> <emphasis>name</emphasis>: Begins a macro
      definition block. This is a scope block that can be inlined
      at arbitrary points with <literal>.invoke</literal>. Arguments to the
      macro will be bound to temporary labels with names like
      <literal>_1</literal>, <literal>_2</literal>, etc.</para></listitem>

      block.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><literal>.invoke</literal> <emphasis>label</emphasis> [<emphasis>argument</emphasis> [,
      <emphasis>argument</emphasis> ...]]: invokes (inlines) the specified
      macro, binding the values of the arguments to the ones the
      macro definition intends to read.  A shorthand for <literal>.invoke</literal>
      is the name of the macro to invoke, backquoted.</para></listitem>
